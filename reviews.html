            <h2>Simply Roomy Changed my Life - A Testimonial</h2>
            <p>When you're someone who is admitted fashion hoarder, I have to confess, it had gotten WAY out of hand. But Elissa
               and her team member Jax changed my life in only 7.5 hours. Learning life lessons along with way without any
               judging or shade but a whole lot of humor and fun. My karma also feels better because what clothes, shows or
               luggage that could not be donated is donated and fabric will be recycled and upcycled!</p>
            <p>Simply Roomy bring happiness, good harmony, organization, healing & positive energy with every minute as your life
               & surroundings are transformed! Found on Thumbtack but brought to me by God or the higher powers because these
               gals are #OrganizingAngels. Let them bring some good into your life - you will NOT regret it, and worth every
               Penny!</p>

            <p>She is also valuable and prompt. She is an amazing organizer and trustworthy. She has relieved me of so many problems dealing with information from the last 40 years. What to keep, what to do-away with are no longer issues that keep me stifled.

            <p>Elissa's work really opened my eyes. It's no easy task to rid yourself of 20 years of memories as well as trash, but she encouraged me the whole way. I also like how she is understanding of people with disabilities that often contribute to their difficulty with organization in the first place. Well done, Elissa!</p>

            <p>I can't say enough good things about Elissa and the quality of her work. She has a way of putting you at ease and allowing you to share your unorganized space without fear of judgement. Then she gets started and all of a sudden you seee results and you have hope that you can do this! On top of that she is a great conversationalist, even a coach in a way, so if you plan to work along side her, it will just flow.</p>

            <p>Elissa is amazing! She will not only organize your stuff but also give you a pep talk about not feeling guilty about failing to do it yourself! So she not only left my house looking amazing, she also lifted my heart and spirit. My house is organized and my heart is light! What more can you ask for!</p>

            <p>Elissa is absolutely phenomenal! She is personable, and has a keen eye for what is workable with a small or large space. I plan to hire her for at least more jobs in my home and have shared her information with my friends. She's a God-send</p>
